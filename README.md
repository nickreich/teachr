Modules for problem-based lesson plans with R

# Why use teachr?

teachr faciliates the sharing and development of open-source problem-oriented statistics curricula and lesson-plans.  Are you looking for an interesting new statistical computing lesson to include in an upcoming course? Browse the teachr content to see if any of the available modules might save you from reinventing  the wheel.  

Also, it is easy to contribute course materials that you have created. And teachr creates a platform to make them easily available to others.

# How does teachr work?

Some awesome (and generous) teachers have already contributed statistics teaching 'modules' to teachr. By downloading the package and using the `module.copy()` function, you can copy all the materials for a particular module to a folder on your computer. The files are then yours to use and modify as you see fit. If you use a module that someone else developed, please give them credit appropriately! If you make substantive changes or improvements, you could offer to the author to have your changes incorporated into the module.

# What is a module?

A module is a set of teaching exercises/activities/assignments on a particular topic. Examples of modules are:

* a hands-on simulation exercise to illustrate the central limit theorem for an undergrad intro stat class, designed to fit into a 75 minute class period.

* a series of in-class and take-home tasks revolving around permutation tests, designed to fit into six 50-minute class periods.

# How do I use a module in my class?

You are free to adapt and use any of the modules from teachr in your class. Please provide proper attribution by giving credit to the author of the module and to the teachr package.

# How can I contribute a module to teachr?

Right now, the best ways to contribute a module are (1) via github or (2) via email to Nick Reich.

# What format does a module need to be in?

Modules have a standardized format. This will enable new users of a module to quickly and easily understand the goals and content of a module. It will also facilitate reporting and aggregation of module content (e.g. creating a script that makes a searchable/sortable database with module names and keywords).
